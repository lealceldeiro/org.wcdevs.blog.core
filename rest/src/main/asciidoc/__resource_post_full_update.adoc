[[resource-post-full-update]]
==== Updating a post (full update only)

A `PUT` request updates a post.

Despite, from a business logic point of view, some fields are optional to be specified for a
*Post* (because they're inferred, for example, such as the `slug` when the post is created), when
doing a full update, all fields described in the table below, must be specified, otherwise they will
be set to `null` (probably causing some validations to fail).

For those fields which are not wished to be changed there are two options:

1. Send in the payload the same value, without change
2. Use a partial <<resource-post-partial-update,update (`PATCH`)>> request
