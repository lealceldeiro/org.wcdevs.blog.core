==== Post statuses

A post can be in one of the following statuses:

 - DRAFT: The post is in edition, has some content, but it's not ready for the public yet.
 - PENDING: The post is ready to be published, but it needs to be reviewed before being actually
publicly available. Most probably an editor needs to approve its content.
 - SCHEDULED: The post is out of edition, it's ready for the public, but it should not be available
until a future date.
 - PROTECTED: The post is ready to be viewed, but only by those with a given password.
 - PUBLISHED: The post is publicly available for everyone.
 - TRASHED: The post has been marked to be deleted, and it should not be publicly visible.
