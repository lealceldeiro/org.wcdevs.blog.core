[[resource-comment-list-all-by-post]]
==== Listing comments

A `GET` request retrieves a list of the comments published for a given post.

This endpoint should rarely be used since maybe it's more useful to retrieve the list of root
comments (see <<resource-comment-list-root-by-post,retrieve root comments of a post>>) or child comments (see <<resource-comment-list-children,retrieve child comments>>), nested under another comment.
