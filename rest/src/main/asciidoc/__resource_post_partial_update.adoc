[[resource-post-partial-update]]
==== Updating a post (partial and full update)

A `PATCH` (full and partial update) request updates a post.

By using this update type, only those fields which are sent in the payload are updated, the rest of
them remain unchanged.

The post `status` is never updated from this request. To update it, the
<<resource-post-full-update, full update>> must be used instead.
